      such as dynamic content updates, form validation, animations, and user interactions. JavaScript can be executed on the client side (in the browser) or on the server side 
      (using environments like Node.js). It is an essential technology for modern web development, alongside HTML and CSS.

    <p>Career and Technical Education (CTE) refers to educational programs and pathways that
       focus on providing students with the knowledge and skills necessary for specific careers or industries.
       CTE programs are designed to prepare individuals for the workforce by combining academic learning with practical,
       hands-on experience in various fields. These programs often include a combination of classroom instruction,
       technical training, and real-world applications to equip students with the competencies needed for success in their
       chosen careers. CTE can encompass a wide range of industries, including healthcare, information technology,
       manufacturing, agriculture, business, and more. The goal of CTE is to bridge the gap between education and employment,
       helping students develop the skills and knowledge required to thrive in today's dynamic job market.</p>
